Karl Ahlrichs [with a K, not a C] - he is an HR guy.  Right now there is a talent shortage in coding.

HR professional with training & development background.   Ten years did corporate out placement - like the movie Up in the Air with George Clooney.  Taught people how to market themselve and find what they wanted to do.  Now licensed insurance agent.  Before was a technical writer.

1)Linked In = This is the best place to find a job or to have them find you.
There is no best resume file, being on linked in is what works.

Everything on Linked In is google searchable - use word which will pop.  At the header - where you describe yourself - liiks like it takes 75 characters, but you can go longer (about 200).  Use up the space.

Photo - crop close to your face - people look for the eyes.

Bottom end is a big open text box - Use this to your power.  Put word salad in there about what you want to do. He ups in he reads the blog of lean theory and lists names - so found when searched.

Video clips are allowed and you should consider using them.  Clip of what you like to/wanbt to do.   Turn phone horizonally to shoot your video.  Get the phone close so the mic picks up.

Need to build a summary and put it at the start of your linked in.  They can go further into the information if they choose.

Recommdations are good to have on your site.  Those who hire read them. 
This is the way everyone stays in touch.




2) HR - makes interview process stressful to see who you really are & how you react under stress
We have to be modern comelia (always able to change)

The interviewer is not looking for the best of the bunch, but how to eliminate the others.  Like Surviver

Group Interviews give you a better advantage - you have mob behavior and one who doesn't like you can be talked out of it.   BE Sure to make constant eye contact with them all.

All of us have something that will work against you, we just don't know what it is.  Need to figure out what the objections will be against you and be pro-active against it.

If you are old you need to keep up with technology.

Questions:
a) Situation, Task, Action, & Result (STAR) question
b) Were do you want go be in 5 years - I don't know what the title is but this with what I want it to include.
c) Tell us what your weakness is - Good answer Peple have told me that I get really obsessive about completing projects on time and get my work life out of balance.
d) Tell me about yourself



3) Job Fit 



Why people can't find job - need focus & know what you want, listening skills, & attitude.

4) Summary
Be sure to start with the summary, then offer to tell the details and the backgound.

5) Structured Interview

Group Interviews give you a better advantage - you have mob behavior and one who doesn't like you can be talked out of it.   BE Sure to make constant eye contact with them all.

6) Cheat sheet for an interview:  Take with and do in pencils so person across can't ready it
Include:
Skill -something you learn
Ability - something you are born with
Accomplishment - can get from Personal Survey
Work Hx - with dates for when they ask.

Why are manhole covers round? - They are the only shape which will not fall through a space

If they toss a problem at you - 
	Tell how you solve all problems
		Examine situation - look at all angles
		Develop idea for an answer
		Apply the answer
		If it works, solve what caused problem
		If it doesn't work, then restart by examining the problem.

Quick Resume structure:
No Objective -
If applying for job - Put title of job applying for
Background summery (see the Richard Saunders' resume he handed out)
	Block of text 
	bulletit points are used to brag
Work history 

Could put line in resume - with caregiver or explain it in the cover letter.
