<h3>Classes</h3>
			<p>A CSS Class is an identifier of an element which can be used multiple times on a page.</p>
			<p><b>Memory device:</b> Classes in school are periods. Remember to us a . whenever you want to reference a class.
			</p>
				<ul> 
					<li>Classes start with . in the selector <b>.anything-you-want-to-name-it</b></li> 
					<li>Again, the same class name can be used more than once within the same file</li>
					<li>The class keyword refers to the class name that you set in the html page in the specific tag.</li>
					<li>In the CSS file, you can identify a class on the whole, or you can identify particluar parts to style (ex: p tags, h3, or li tags)</li>
